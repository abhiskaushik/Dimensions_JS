# Dimensions_JS
Dimensions (previously known as Visual Match) is a pattern-matching game written for Sugar; it is included as part of the Honey collection of Sugar add-ons. The object of the game is to find sets of three cards where each attribute—color, shape, number of elements, and shading—either match on all three cards or are different on all three cards.

Prime Dimensions is the number variant of Dimensions, where instead of shape, three prime numbers, 5, 7, and 11, are used. Texture is replaced by representation, e.g. Arabic numerals, Roman numerals, Mayan numerals, etc.

Word Dimensions is the word variant of Dimensions, where instead of shape, three word categories are used: animal, food, celestial body. Texture is replaced by font attribute: bold, italic, normal.

Visual Match is deprecated.
